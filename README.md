## NetLogo Language Support for CodeMirror 6

This repository contains work in progress by Ruth Bagley (@rbagley), Haylie Wu (@wubbalubbadu), and John Chen (@CIVITAS-John), aimed at providing NetLogo language support for CodeMirror 6.

### Prerequisites

To set up the environment, use `npm install`. You might also need to install `rollup` and `lezer-generator` globally by running the following commands:

```
npm install @lezer/generator --global
npm install rollup --global
```

### Building the Project

To build the project, run `npm build` or `npm release`. The second command creates an uglified and compressed bundle.
